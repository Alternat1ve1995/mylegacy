Usage:

1) Double click on "merge.bat".
2) Follow the instructions in console.
3) Script will try to merge your pull request every N seconds. When merge is done it will exit.

P.S. Make shure your Python 2.7 is in PATH.
P.P.S. To make script work, the account you are using should have Bitbucket merge permissions.
P.P.P.S. Bitbucked did a redisign one time while I was using a script, so it was not working.
			I updated the script, and it now (31.07.2018) works fine.
			Remember, if Bitbucket will do a critical redisign again, script will become outdated.
			But you still can see the code and update it a bit, using already existing ideas :)
